Question 1: Setting Alerts in a New Monitoring System

How do you determine which alerts to set in a new monitoring system?
Note: In Project 1, you did not set up any alerts. However, you still have enough experience to answer this question.

1. Restate the Problem


2. Provide a Concrete Example Scenario
- Describe the network you built for Project 1. Identify the VMs on the network and what they do.
  

- Which VMs should be publicly accessible?

- Which VMs should not be publicly accessible?


3. Explain the Solution Requirements

- Consider the VMs that should not be publicly accessible from the internet. Which alert(s) should these VMs fire and when?

- Why should these VMs be associated with these alerts?


4. Explain the Solution Details

- Which tool in Project 1 would you use to set such an alert?

- What would the alert rule be? For example, would the alert fire upon a failed SSH attempt or a ping request?


5. Identify Advantages and Disadvantages

- Are there any malicious circumstances that the alert(s) discussed above do not address?
